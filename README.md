# tag-it

Odin project tagging app. This project is inspired by "Where is Waldo". The development of the app featured all of the previously learned topics and simple BaaS (Firebase) to store and serve user data. Moreover, this is the first website in which I have used Typescript for development. The project uses imagery by [Laurie Greasley](https://nexusroku.tumblr.com/) and [Josan Gonzalez](https://www.instagram.com/deathburger/).
